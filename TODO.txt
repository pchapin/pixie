These items are in no particular order, but they probably should be arranged in order of
priority and/or level of difficulty.

+ Define an XML format for the tasks file and implement support for it.

+ Update the documentation to describe Pixie's "time tracker" features.

+ Add support for a configuration file?

+ Make the existing features more robust against bad input. An error message display function
  should be added. Right now the program mostly just ignores errors without telling the user
  about them.

+ Add new features.
  - It might be nice to have an option to exit the program without saving the task list.
  - An indication that the task list has changed (so the user knows when to "save").
